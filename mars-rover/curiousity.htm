                <h3>Mission Overview</h3>
                <p>Curiosity landed in Gale Crater on August 6, 2012, with a mission to determine whether Mars ever offered an environment that could support microbial life. It has been tirelessly exploring the landscape to this day. It has discovered signs of life, noted significant radiation, and proved to us that somewhere in our wide galaxy, we may not have always been alone in our curiosity.</p>

                <h3>Key Discoveries</h3>
                <p>Curiosity has made several discoveries that have provided us much needed insight into the red planet. It found evidence of liquid water upon reaching Mount Sharp, it found truths that life could be supported as Mars contains the necessary elements, and it gathered evidence of organic carbon within the rock samples it vigorously analyzed.</p>

                <h3>Technical Features</h3>
                <p>The Curiosity rover hoists a wealth of impressive scientific equipment. Its mastcam allows it to navigate the Martian terrain with accuracy while providing important imaging. It also totes a spectrometer that uses x-ray technology to check the abundance of chemicals in samples. Last but not least, it also carries a RAD detector in order to inform us back home of any dangerous radiation.</p>
