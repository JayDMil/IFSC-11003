                <h3>Mission Overview</h3>
                <p>Perseverance landed in Jezero Crater on February 18, 2021. Its primary mission is to seek signs of ancient life and collect rock and soil samples for a possible future return to Earth. The landing site, Jezero Crater, was chosen because it is believed to have once been a river delta, a promising place to find preserved signs of life.</p>

                <h3>Major Accomplishments</h3>
                <p>A key accomplishment of the mission is the successful deployment and flight of the Ingenuity helicopter, the first powered, controlled flight on another planet. Perseverance has also begun collecting its first rock core samples, which are being cached on the surface for a future sample-return mission.</p>

                <h3>Technical Features</h3>
                <p>Perseverance is equipped with advanced instruments, including the SHERLOC and WATSON cameras for fine-scale detection of minerals and organic molecules. It also has a drill for coring samples and an internal system for sealing them in tubes. Like Curiosity, it is powered by an MMRTG.</p>
