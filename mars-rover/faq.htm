                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Why do we explore Mars?</dt>
                    <dd>Mars is the most accessible planet in our solar system. It holds the potential to answer key questions about the existence of life beyond Earth. Understanding Mars's geology and climate history can also teach us more about our own planet's past and future.</dd>

                    <dt>How do the rovers get their power?</dt>
                    <dd>Most Mars rovers are solar-powered, using panels to convert sunlight into electricity. However, the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers use a Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG), which converts heat from the natural decay of plutonium-238 into electricity.</dd>

                    <dt>How long does it take to send a signal to Mars?</dt>
                    <dd>The time it takes for a signal to travel between Earth and Mars varies depending on the planets' positions. It can be as short as 4 minutes or as long as 24 minutes each way.</dd>

                    <dt>Can the rovers be controlled in real-time?</dt>
                    <dd>No, due to the communication delay, rovers cannot be "driven" in real-time. Mission controllers on Earth create a sequence of commands and send them to the rover, which then executes the commands autonomously.</dd>
